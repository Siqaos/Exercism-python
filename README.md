# Exercism track on Python

Hello, I'm using python 3.6,

I'm trying to improve myself on it so I stumbled upon Exercism.io which gives really nice exercises from easy to hard.
Been doing easy ones for now to get accustomed to Data Structures etc..
I'll push every once in a while to keep this repository updated.

The "Other" Folder contain bunch of stuff I found and wanted to try them on python, such as the Ackerman Function or a file reading function.

If you have any suggestion to improve any of my solutions please feel free to contact me.

Kind regards, Hamza.
